Green dot: starting and finishing position of the scan cycle. Blue dot: finishing position of the odd numbered scanlines and starting position of the even numbered scanlines. In the images, the pin header that was holding the carbon fiber is visible above the green dot. Due to its small size, the carbon fiber itself, and the point where it touches the surface of the reaction mixture is invisible in these images. On the left side the end of the double wall reference electrode is visible.}}{4}}
